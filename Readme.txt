Deep Learning Introduction:
1 Deep learning is define about to working on complex neural networks. This topic is subset of the Machine learning.
Types of layer in deep learning:
1. Input Layer:
Recieves the raw data to the machine

2. Hidden Layer
perform the computations in the hidden layer which  is process the data 

3. Output Layer
provide the final output and prediction on classification


Activation functions in Deep Learning:


1.ReLU : Rectified Liner Unit:
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data nad which is siply used to speed up during the training of the data.

2.sigmoid:
map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer).

3.softmax:

convert the raw data  (score)  into the probability on the givendata.

Back propogation and optimisation:

In this propogration step we use some of the example -mse(means standard error),cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data.
